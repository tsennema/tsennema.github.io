            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a Chemical Engineering graduate, based in Waterloo, Ontario looking to transition into a
                software-focused industry.</p>
            <p>My experience post-graduation has been in a manufacturing environment, where I found that the
                opportunities to optimize processes using tools like Microsoft VBA and database apps were the most
                engaging of my projects.</p>
            <p>I have since worked on several small-scale applications to build skill and familiarity with staple
                programming languages Python and JavaScript, and taken some online courses to get up to speed with
                beginner CS topics.</p>
