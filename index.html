            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a Chemical Engineering graduate, based in Waterloo, Ontario looking to transition into a
                software-focused industry.</p>
            <p>My experience post-graduation has been in a manufacturing environment, where I found that the
                opportunities to optimize processes using tools like Microsoft VBA and database apps were the most
                engaging of my projects.</p>
            <p>I have since worked on several small-scale applications to build skill and familiarity with staple
                programming languages Python and JavaScript, and taken some online courses to get up to speed with
                beginner CS topics.</p>

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <h2>Issue Tracker</h2>

            </ul>
            <h2>Raffle Draw</h2>
            <p>This project is a simple web app designed to help a user select a few options from a longer list, with
                some extra features. It was originally built with a Flask(Python) backend, but it was converted to
                client-side JS for personal use without the need for a dedicated server. </p>
            <p>Key Features Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select multiple unique options</li>

                <li>Ability to prevent duplicate tags</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Skills Showcased Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript FrontEnd Development</li>
                <li>Using code for practical solutions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Game Room Navigator</h2>
            <p>There has been a recent trend in videos and streams around playing games that have had the map
                transitions randomized. This can become overwhelming and so this project is intended to help manage the
                process of playing through such a challenge. The default set-up is for Nintendo’s Pokémon Emerald game,
                but could be easily altered to manage other games.</p>
            <p>Key Features Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding connections between room transitions</li>
                <li>Labeling dead ends and points of interest</li>
                <li>Provide navigation instructions between hubs or points of interest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Skills Showcased Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript FrontEnd Development</li>
                <li>Using code for practical solutions</li>
            </ul>
